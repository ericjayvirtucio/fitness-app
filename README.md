# Fitness App

Production-oriented foundation for an offline-first fitness platform targeting iOS, Android, and a supporting API.

The current foundation includes an accessible Expo Router shell, an app-local
semantic design system, a pure shared domain language, versioned mobile SQLite
infrastructure, a device-local personal profile, and profile-derived Goals &
Energy calculations. It
intentionally contains no authentication, synchronization, analytics,
notifications, or AI integration.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 or later
- pnpm 11 or later (the repository pins the expected version)
- Platform tooling required by [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) when running a simulator or device

## Setup

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

For the first install before a lockfile exists, use `pnpm install`.

## Common commands

```bash
pnpm dev           # Run all development servers
pnpm build         # Build/export all applications
pnpm format:check  # Verify formatting
pnpm lint          # Run lint checks
pnpm test          # Run automated tests
pnpm typecheck     # Run strict TypeScript checks
```

Run one application with a workspace filter:

```bash
pnpm --filter @fitness/mobile dev
pnpm --filter @fitness/api dev
```

The API reads `PORT` when it is supplied and otherwise listens on port `3000`. Phase 0 requires no secrets or environment file.

## Repository map

- `apps/mobile`: Expo and React Native application shell
- `apps/api`: NestJS API shell
- `packages/domain`: pure, framework-independent domain values and invariants
- `packages/typescript-config`: shared strict compiler policies
- `docs`: architecture and durable engineering decisions
- `specs`: rules for future approved specifications
- `infrastructure`: admission rules for future operational configuration
- `.github`: collaboration templates and CI quality gates

## Current status

Sprint 6: Goals & Energy. Eligible adults can view profile-derived BMI, resting
energy, estimated maintenance calories, and a validated daily calorie target.
One lose, maintain, or gain configuration persists locally in schema version 3;
derived values remain unstored. All cloud behavior remains deferred.
